        <p>Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase physical
            fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady
            speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance training.
    
            Jogging is running at a gentle pace, its definition, as compared with running, is not standard. One definition
            describes jogging as running slower than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h). Running is sometimes defined as requiring a
            moment of no contact to the ground, whereas jogging often sustains the contact.
